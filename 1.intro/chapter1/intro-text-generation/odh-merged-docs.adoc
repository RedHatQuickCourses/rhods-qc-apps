[id="adding-a-custom-model-serving-runtime_{context}"]
= Adding a custom model-serving runtime

A model-serving runtime provides integration with a specified model server and the model frameworks that it supports. By default, {productname-long} includes the OpenVINO Model Server runtime. However, if this runtime doesn't meet your needs (it doesn't support a particular model framework, for example), you might want to add your own, custom runtimes.

As an administrator, you can use the {productname-short} interface to add and enable custom model-serving runtimes. You can then choose from your enabled runtimes when you create a new model server.

[role='_abstract']

.Prerequisites
* You have logged in to {productname-short} as an administrator.
ifdef::upstream[]
* You are familiar with how to link:{odhdocshome}/working-on-data-science-projects/#adding-a-model-server-to-your-data-science-project_nb-server[add a model server to your project]. When you have added a custom model-serving runtime, you must configure a new model server to use the runtime.

When you have added a custom model-serving runtime, you must configure a new model server to use the runtime.
endif::[]
* You have reviewed the example runtimes in the https://github.com/kserve/modelmesh-serving/tree/main/config/runtimes[kserve/modelmesh-serving^] repository. You can use these examples as _starting points_. However, each runtime requires some further modification before you can deploy it in {productname-short}. The required modifications are described in the following procedure.
+
NOTE: {productname-short} includes the OpenVINO Model Server model-serving runtime by default. You do not need to add this runtime to {productname-short}.

.Procedure
. From the {productname-short} dashboard, click *Settings* > *Serving runtimes*.
+
The *Serving runtimes* page opens and shows the model-serving runtimes that are already installed and enabled in your {productname-short} deployment. By default, the OpenVINO Model Server runtime is pre-installed and enabled in {productname-short}.
. To add a new, custom runtime, click *Add serving runtime*.
+
The *Add serving runtime* page opens.
. To start adding a new runtime, perform one of the following sets of actions:
+
--
* *To upload a YAML file*
.. Click *Upload files*.
+
A file browser opens.
.. In the file browser, select a YAML file on your computer. This file might be the one of the example runtimes that you downloaded from the https://github.com/kserve/modelmesh-serving/tree/main/config/runtimes[kserve/modelmesh-serving^] repository.
+
The embedded YAML editor opens and shows the contents of the file that you uploaded.

* *To enter YAML code directly in the editor*
.. Click *Start from scratch*.
+
The embedded YAML editor opens with no content.
.. Enter or paste YAML code directly in the embedded editor. The YAML that you paste might be copied from one of the example runtimes in the https://github.com/kserve/modelmesh-serving/tree/main/config/runtimes[kserve/modelmesh-serving^] repository.
--

. Optional: If you are adding one of the example runtimes in the https://github.com/kserve/modelmesh-serving/tree/main/config/runtimes[kserve/modelmesh-serving^] repository, perform the following modifications:
.. In the YAML editor, locate the `kind` field for your runtime. Update the value of this field to `ServingRuntime`.
.. In the YAML editor, locate the `containers.image` field for your runtime. Based on the runtime that you are adding, update the field to one of the following:
+
--
Nvidia Triton Inference Server::
+
`image: nvcr.io/nvidia/tritonserver:21.06.1-py3`

Seldon Python MLServer::
+
`image: seldonio/mlserver:0.5.2`

TorchServe::
+
`image: pytorch/torchserve:0.6.0-cpu`
--

. In the `metadata.name` field, ensure that the value of the runtime you are adding is unique (that is, the value isn't the same as for a runtime you have already added).

. Optional: To configure a custom display name for the runtime that you are adding, add a `metadata.annotations.openshift.io/display-name` field and specify a value, as shown in the following example:
+
[source]
----
apiVersion: serving.kserve.io/v1alpha1
kind: ServingRuntime
metadata:
  name: mlserver-0.x
  annotations:
    openshift.io/display-name: MLServer
----
+
NOTE: If you do not configure a custom display name for your runtime, {productname-short} shows the value of the `metadata.name` field.

. Click *Add*.
+
The *Serving runtimes* page opens and shows the updated list of runtimes that are installed. Observe that the runtime you added is automatically enabled.

. Optional: To edit your custom runtime, click the action menu (&#8942;) and select *Edit*.
+
NOTE: You cannot directly edit the OpenVINO Model Server runtime that is included in {productname-short} by default. However, you can _clone_ this runtime and edit the cloned version. You can then add the edited clone as a new, custom runtime. To do this, click the action menu beside the OpenVINO Model Server and select *Clone*.

.Verification
* The model-serving runtime you added is shown in an enabled state on the *Serving runtimes* page.

[id="exporting-a-pipeline-in-jupyterlab_{context}"]
= Exporting a pipeline in JupyterLab

[role='_abstract']
You can export pipelines that you have created in JupyterLab. When you export a pipeline, the pipeline is prepared for later execution, but is not uploaded or executed immediately. During the export process, any package dependencies are uploaded to S3-compatible storage. Also, pipeline code is generated for the target runtime.

Before you can export a pipeline, you must create a data science project and a pipeline server. After you create a pipeline server, you must create a workbench within the same project as your pipeline server. In addition, your pipeline instance in JupyterLab must contain a runtime configuration. If you create a workbench as part of a data science project, a default runtime configuration is created automatically. However, if you create a notebook from the Jupyter tile in the {productname-short} dashboard, you must create a runtime configuration before you can export your pipeline in JupyterLab. A runtime configuration defines connectivity information for your pipeline instance and S3-compatible cloud storage.

[role='_abstract']
When you start Jupyter for the first time, or after stopping your notebook server, you must select server options in the *Start a notebook server* wizard so that the software and variables that you expect are available on your server. This section explains the options available in the *Start a notebook server* wizard in detail.

The *Start a notebook server* page is divided into several sections:

Notebook image:: Specifies the container image that your notebook server is based on. Different notebook images have different packages installed by default. If the notebook image contains multiple versions, you can select the notebook image version to use from the *Versions* section.
+
ifdef::upstream[]
[NOTE]
--
When a new version of a notebook image is released, the previous version remains available and supported on the cluster. This gives you time to migrate your work to the latest version of the notebook image.
--
endif::[]
ifndef::upstream[]
[NOTE]
--
Notebook images are supported for a minimum of one year. Major updates to pre-configured notebook images occur approximately every six months. Therefore, two supported notebook images are typically available at any given time. To use the latest package versions, Red Hat recommends that you use the most recently added notebook image.
--
endif::[]
+
After you start a notebook image, you can check which Python packages are installed on your notebook server and which version of the package you have by running the `pip` tool in a notebook cell.

= Overview of pipeline runs

[role='_abstract']
A pipeline run is a single execution of a data science pipeline. As data scientist, you can use {productname-short} to define, manage, and track executions of a data science pipeline. You can view a record of your data science project's previously executed and scheduled runs from the *Runs* page in the {productname-short} user interface.

Runs are intended for portability. Therefore, you can clone your pipeline runs to reproduce and scale them accordingly, or delete them when you longer require them. You can configure a run to execute only once immediately after creation or on a recurring basis. Recurring runs consist of a copy of a pipeline with all of its parameter values and a run trigger. A run trigger indicates when a recurring run executes. You can define the following run triggers:

* Periodic: used for scheduling runs to execute in intervals.
* Cron: used for scheduling runs as a cron job.

When executed, you can track the run's progress from the run's *Details* page on the {productname-short} user interface. From here, you can view the run's graph, and output artifacts.

A pipeline run can be classified as the following: 

* Scheduled run: A pipeline run scheduled to execute at least once
* Triggered run: A previously executed pipeline run.

You can use Elyra to create visual end-to-end pipeline workflows in JupyterLab. Elyra is an extension for JupyterLab that provides you with a Pipeline Editor to create pipeline workflows that can be executed in {productname-short}.

ifdef::upstream[]
Before you can work with pipelines in JupyterLab, you must install the Data Science Pipelines operator as described in link:https://github.com/opendatahub-io/data-science-pipelines-operator[Data Science Pipelines Operator].
endif::[]
ifndef::upstream[]
Before you can work with pipelines in JupyterLab, you must install the OpenShift Pipelines operator. For more information about installing a compatible version of the OpenShift Pipelines operator, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.13/html/cicd/pipelines#op-release-notes[Red Hat OpenShift Pipelines release notes] and link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/6986416[Red Hat Openshift Data Science: Supported Configurations].
endif::[]

You can access the Elyra extension within JupyterLab when you create the most recent version of one of the following notebook images:

* Standard Data Science
* PyTorch
* TensorFlow
* TrustyAI

As you can use the Pipeline Editor to visually design your pipelines, minimal coding is required to create and run pipelines. For more information about Elyra, see link:https://elyra.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/overview.html[Elyra Documentation]. For more information on the Pipeline Editor, see link:https://elyra.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_guide/jupyterlab-interface.html#visual-pipeline-editor[Visual Pipeline Editor]. After you have created your pipeline, you can run it locally in JupyterLab, or remotely using data science pipelines in {productname-short}.

The pipeline creation process consists of the following tasks:

* Create a data science project that contains a workbench.
* Create a pipeline server.
* Create a new pipeline in the Pipeline Editor in JupyterLab.
* Develop your pipeline by adding Python notebooks or Python scripts and defining their runtime properties.
* Define execution dependencies.
* Run or export your pipeline.

Before you can run a pipeline in JupyterLab, your pipeline instance must contain a runtime configuration. A runtime configuration defines connectivity information for your pipeline instance and S3-compatible cloud storage.

If you create a workbench as part of a data science project, a default runtime configuration is created automatically. However, if you create a notebook from the Jupyter tile in the {productname-short} dashboard, you must create a runtime configuration before you can run your pipeline in JupyterLab. For more information about runtime configurations, see link:https://elyra.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_guide/runtime-conf.html[Runtime Configuration]. As a prerequisite, before you create a workbench, ensure that you have created and configured a pipeline server within the same data science project as your workbench.

You can use S3-compatible cloud storage to make data available to your notebooks and scripts while they are executed. Your cloud storage must be accessible from the machine in your deployment that runs JupyterLab and from the cluster that hosts Data Science Pipelines. Before you create and run pipelines in JupyterLab, ensure that you have your s3-compatible storage credentials readily available.

[IMPORTANT]
====
While every effort is made to make {productname-long} resilient to OpenShift node failure, upgrades, and similarly disruptive operations, individual users' notebook environments can be interrupted during these events. If an OpenShift node restarts or becomes unavailable, any user notebook environment on that node is restarted on a different node. When this occurs, any ongoing process executing in the user's notebook environment is interrupted, and the user needs to re-execute it when their environment becomes available again.

Due to this limitation, Red Hat recommends that processes for which interruption is unacceptable are not executed in the Jupyter notebook server environment on {productname-short}.

== Global navigation

There are four items in the top navigation:

* The *Toggle side navigation menu* button (image:images/rhods-sidenav-toggle-icon.png["Toggle side navigation menu icon",]) toggles whether or not the side navigation is displayed.
* The *Notifications* button (image:images/rhods-notifications-icon.png["Notifications icon"]) opens and closes the *Notifications* drawer, letting you read current and previous notifications in more detail.
ifdef::upstream[]
* The *Help* menu (image:images/rhods-help-icon.png["Help menu icon"]) provides a link to access the {productname-short} documentation.
endif::[]
ifndef::upstream[]
* The *Help* menu (image:images/rhods-help-icon.png["Help menu icon"]) provides a link to create a ticket with Red Hat Support and access the {productname-short} documentation.
endif::[]
* The *User* menu displays the name of the currently logged-in user and provides access to the *Log out* button.

== Side navigation

There are three main sections in the side navigation:

Applications -> Enabled:: The *Enabled* page displays applications that are enabled and ready to use on {productname-short}. This page is the default landing page for {productname-short}.
+
Click the *Launch application* button on an application card to open the application interface in a new tab. If an application has an associated quick start tour, click the drop-down menu on the application's card and select *Open quick start* to access it. This page also displays applications and components that have been disabled by your administrator. Disabled applications are denoted with `Disabled` on the application's card. Click *Disabled* on the application's card to access links allowing you to remove the card itself, and to re-validate its license, if the license had previously expired.

Applications -> Explore:: The *Explore* page displays applications that are available for use with {productname-short}.
Click on a card for more information about the application or to access the *Enable* button.
The *Enable* button is visible only if an application does not require an OpenShift Operator installation. 

Data science projects:: The *Data science projects* page allows you to organize your data science work into a single project. From this page, you can create and manage data science projects. You can also enhance the capabilities of your data science project by adding workbenches, adding storage to your project's cluster, adding data connections, and adding model servers.

Data Science Pipelines -> Pipelines:: The *Pipelines* page allows you to import, manage, track, and view data science pipelines. Using {productname-long} pipelines, you can standardize and automate machine learning workflows to enable you to develop and deploy your data science models.

Data Science Pipelines -> Runs:: The *Runs* page allows you to define, manage, and track executions of a data science pipeline. A pipeline run is a single execution of a data science pipeline. You can also view a record of previously executed and scheduled runs for your data science project.

Model Serving:: The *Model Serving* page allows you to manage and view the status of your deployed models. You can use this page to deploy data science models to serve intelligent applications, or to view existing deployed models. You can also determine the inference endpoint of a deployed model.

Resources:: The *Resources* page displays learning resources such as documentation, how-to material, and quick start tours. You can filter visible resources using the options displayed on the left, or enter terms into the search bar.

Settings -> Notebook images:: The *Notebook image settings* page allows you to configure custom notebook images that cater to your project's specific requirements. After you have added custom notebook images to your deployment of {productname-short}, they are available for selection when creating a notebook server.

Settings -> Cluster settings::  The *Cluster settings* page allows you perform the following administrative tasks on your cluster:
* Enable or disable Red Hat's ability to collect data about {productname-short} usage on your cluster.
* Configure how resources are claimed within your cluster by changing the default size of the cluster's persistent volume claim (PVC).
* Reduce resource usage in your {productname-short} deployment by stopping notebook servers that have been idle.
* Schedule notebook pods on tainted nodes by adding tolerations.

Settings -> User management:: The *User and group settings* page allows you to define {productname-short} user group and admin group membership.

[role='_abstract']
You can update your data science project's model server by changing details, such as the number of deployed replicas, the server size, the token authorization, and how the project is accessed.

.Prerequisites
* You have logged in to {productname-long}.
ifndef::upstream[]
* If you are using specialized {productname-short} groups, you are part of the user group or admin group (for example, `rhods-users` or `rhods-admins`) in OpenShift.
endif::[]
ifdef::upstream[]
* If you are using specialized {productname-short} groups, you are part of the user group or admin group (for example, `odh-users` or `odh-admins`) in OpenShift.
endif::[]
* You have created a data science project that has a model server assigned.

.Procedure
. From the {productname-short} dashboard, click *Data Science Projects*.
+
The *Data science projects* page opens.
. Click the name of the project whose model server details you want to update.
+
A project details page opens.
. In the *Models and model servers* section, locate the model server you want to update. Click the action menu (*&#8942;*)   and select *Edit model server*.
+
The *Configure model server* dialog opens.
. Update the model server properties, as follows:
+
NOTE: You cannot change the *Serving runtime* selection for a model server that is already configured. This protects against changing to a runtime that does not support already-deployed models.

.. In the *Model server name* field, enter a new, unique name for the model server.

.. In the *Number of model replicas to deploy* field, specify a value.
.. From the *Model server size* list, select one of the following server sizes:
* Small
* Medium
* Large
* Custom
.. Optional: If you selected *Custom* in the preceding step, configure the following settings in the *Model server size* section to customize your model server:
... In the *CPUs requested* field, specify a number of CPUs to use with your model server. Use the list beside this field to specify the value in cores or millicores.
... In the *CPU limit* field, specify the maximum number of CPUs to use with your model server. Use the list beside this field to specify the value in cores or millicores.
... In the *Memory requested* field, specify the requested memory for the model server in gibibytes (Gi).
... In the *Memory limit* field, specify the maximum memory limit for the model server in gibibytes (Gi).
.. Optional: In the *Model server GPUs* field, specify a number of GPUs to use with your model server.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
{productname-short} includes two versions of the OpenVINO Model Server (OVMS) runtime by default; a version that supports GPUs and one that does not. To use GPUs, from the *Serving runtime* list, you must select the version whose display name includes `Supports GPUs`.

If you are using a _custom_ model-serving runtime with your model server, you must ensure that your custom runtime supports GPUs and is appropriately configured to use them.
====

.. Optional: In the *Model route* section, select the *Make deployed models available through an external route* check box to make your deployed models available to external clients.
.. Optional: In the *Token authorization* section, select the *Require token authentication* check box to require token authentication for your model server. To finish configuring token authentication, perform the following actions:
... In the *Service account name* field, enter a service account name for which the token will be generated. The generated token is created and displayed in the *Token secret* field when the model server is configured.
... To add an additional service account, click *Add a service account* and enter another service account name.
. Click *Configure*.

.Verification
* The model server that you updated is displayed in the *Models and model servers* section on the project details page.
